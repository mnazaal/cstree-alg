# Code for learning CStrees [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mnazaal/cstree-alg/HEAD)

To use the code, either download the files and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies, and install Jupyter notebook/lab (lab preferable) via `pip install jupyterlab` running Python 3.9.6, or use a mybinder instance running [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mnazaal/cstree-alg/HEAD), which takes care of most of the dependencies. Plotting does not work on mybinder yet since it needs OS-level packages - namely graphviz. Hence, please comment the lines which use the `visualize` method.
